# Mirror-recording
This is my simple video recorder that used OpenCV. It is equipped with mirror mode.

When you run the program, the video appears through the webcam. (The output is 30 frames!)

Pressing the space bar starts recording mode, and a red circle is displayed at the top left of the screen.

Pressing the space bar again ends recording mode, and the image is saved with the mp4 extension.

Pressing the '1' key (or '!' key) enables screen horizontal inversion.

Press esc to exit the program.
